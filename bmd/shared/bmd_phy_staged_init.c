 * BMD Staged PHY Initialization
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * This module is designed to reduce PHY initialization time by
 * allowing PHY initialization to be done in separate stages, which
 * are completed for all PHYs before moving to the next init stage.
 * The two main advantages are:
 *
 *   1) Support for PHY firmware broadcast
 *   2) Reduce impact of wait loops
 *
 * The staged initialization is done via PhyConfig_InitStage, where
 * the current stage is supplied as a parameter.  Each PHY driver
 * determines how many init stages are required for a particular PHY.
 * When all stages are completed, the driver should return
 * CDK_E_UNAVAIL for any subsequent calls.
 *
 * For proper broadcast support the PHY driver must support
 * PhyConfig_BcastAddr, which returns the broadcast domain of the PHY
 * bus driver.  Based on this, the init stage control module will mark
 * one PHY in each domain as the master (PHY_F_BCAST_MSTR), and this
 * information can then be used by the PHY driver to determine what to
 * do at each init stage, for example:
 *
 *   Stage 1: Enter broadcast mode (all instances)
 *   Stage 2: Download firmware (master only via broadcast)
 *   Stage 3: Exit broadcast mode (all instances)
 *   Stage 4: Start firmware microcontroller
 *   Stage 5: Additional initialization as needed
 *
 * If the PHY loads firmware from an externa ROM, the staged init can
 * optimize the wait loops as shown in thew following example:
 *
 *   Stage 1: Initiate ROM load
 *   Stage 2: Wait for ROM load completion
 *   Stage 3: Start firmware microcontroller
 *   Stage 4: Wait for CRC calculation
 *   Stage 5: Additional initialization as needed
 *
 * The advantage is that all PHYs load firmware in parallel, so once
 * the first PHY has completed the download seqeunce, it is very
 * likely that all other PHYs are done as well.  Likewise, if CRC
 * calculation is done by the firmware, then this can be done in
 * parallel.
 *
 * If a PHY driver in the PHY chain does not support staged
 * inititialization, then the normal init function will be called.
 * Drivers that support staged init may still have their normal init
 * function called, if they are downstream from a driver that does not
 * support staged init.  In this case the driver should turn off
 * staged init (clear PHY_F_STAGED_INIT flag) and perform standard
 * initialization.
